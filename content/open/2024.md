## Evolving and Excelling: My 2024 Badge Collection
> Small wins are essential, not just for the victories themselves, but because they give you more energy, self-confidence, and enthusiasm about your job, company, and yourself. - Lynda Gratton

A total of **12** badges was collected.

## Once more into the fray...
> Speech has power. Words do not fade. What starts out as a sound, ends in a deed. - Abraham Joshua Herschel

> The patient hunter spends most of his time in the blind - The Marshal, Motherland: Fort Salem S03E04

> We must meet the challenge, rather than wish it were not before us - Justice Brennan

> Walk a mile to avoid a fight, but when one starts, don't back down an inch.

> Strength forged in overcoming today's obstacles fuels tomorrow's victories.

Once more into the fray,  
Into the last good fight I'll ever know.  
Live and die on this day.  
Live and die on this day.  
...  

By Dylan Thomas
