This note documents the inspirations behind the design of my personal website, which has undergone two iterations thus far.

## Initial version of my Personal Site
I created my initial version of my personal site in September 2022 by implementing elements of the [colorlib](https://colorlib.com/) template [Ronin](https://preview.colorlib.com/#ronin).

I wanted to create a personal site but didn't know where to get started with the design process so I decided to go for the mimic approach.

I feel at this point in my web development journey I preferred to mimic or work with templates as designing from scratch felt intimidating.

I was drawn to the [Ronin template](https://colorlib.com/wp/template/ronin/) as it looked simple and professional.

## Current site

### It started with an obsession with the Silo's computers
I am a fan of Apple TV+'s sci-fi series [Silo](https://tv.apple.com/us/show/silo/umc.cmc.3yksgc857px0k0rqe5zd4jice).

So when I decided to redesign my personal site, I started with this photo from the TV show:

I loved that the operating system had a green base colour and sprinkles of orange just like the [Hacker Bytes](https://hackerbytes.hackthedegree.com/) colour palette. I also loved the simplicity of the design and just how "old school" it looked.

To expand on this design idea I then googled images of old monochrome PCs:

This inspiration led to:
+ **Bash navigation system**. I wanted to be able to get around this blog without using the mouse hence the introduction of:
    - ls
    - cat
    - history -c
    - using arrows to view previously executed commands
    - using arrows to navigate image galleries
+ **Fixed size list view** that requires you to scroll the items. I wanted the User to remain in one place and hence have the header, list view content and footer appear fixed. I wanted the design to feel minimalist, to have a *limited* feel to it.
+ A focus on using as few colours as possible: green, orange, white and grey. I initially wanted to push for a full monochrome palette actually.

Design concerns:
+ **Bash navigation system**. Though I think it's cool and I will be able to use it, it's unclear yet how I will let visitors experience this feature.
+ **Not everyone's cup of tea**. The design is very nerdy and tech-based which might appear very strange to non-programmers. I intend to share some of my posts with students, I wonder how the User Experience will be for them.

### Other influences
+ Whenever I am stuck on how to position an element or display something I started by looking at how [Guide Fari](https://guidefari.com/) had implemented it. He doesn't call his personal site a blog or even a personal site, just a digital garden. When I started the redesign I was not looking to create a blog or digital CV, just a space to be myself online so he's site design had a similar underlying philosophy.
+ Elements from [Brittany Chiang](https://brittanychiang.com/)'s blog inspired my Project display page.
+ Elements from [Jamie Zawinski](https://www.jwz.org/about.html)'s blog inspired my About page.
