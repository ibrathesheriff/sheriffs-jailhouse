This note documents the inspirations behind the design of my personal website, which has undergone two iterations thus far.

## Initial version of my Personal Site
I created my initial version of my personal site in September 2022 by implementing elements of the [colorlib](https://colorlib.com/) template [Ronin](https://preview.colorlib.com/#ronin).

I wanted to create a personal site but didn't know where to get started with the design process so I decided to go for the mimic approach. I was drawn to the [Ronin template](https://colorlib.com/wp/template/ronin/) as it looked simple and professional.

## Current site

### It started with an obsession with the Silo's computers
I am a fan of Apple TV+'s sci-fi series [Silo](https://tv.apple.com/us/show/silo/umc.cmc.3yksgc857px0k0rqe5zd4jice).

So when I decided to redesign my personal site, I started with this photo from the TV show:

I loved that the operating system had a green base colour and sprinkles of orange just like current colour scheme [Hacker Bytes](https://hackerbytes.hackthedegree.com/). I also loved the simplicity of the design and just how old school it looked.

To expand on this design I idea I then googled images of old monochrome PCs:

This inspiration led to:
+ **Bash navigation system**. I wanted to be able to get around this blog without using the mouse hence the introduction of:
    - ls
    - cat
    - history -c
    - using arrows to view previously executed commands
    - using arrows to navigate image galleries
+ **Fixed size list view** that requires you to scroll the items.
+ A focus on using as few colours as possible: green, orange, white and grey.

### Other influences
+ Whenever I am stuck on how to position an element or display something I start by looking at how [Guide Fari](https://guidefari.com/) has done it. He doesn't call his personal site a blog or even a personal site, just a digital garden. When I started the redesign I was not looking to create a blog or digital CV, just a space to be myself online.
+ Elements from [Brittany Chiang](https://brittanychiang.com/)'s blog inspired my projects image.
+ Elements from [Jamie Zawinski](https://www.jwz.org/about.html)'s blog inspired my About page.
