This note summarises key points from videos and readings on setting up a system on Obsidian.

## Why do I want to start using Obsidian?

It all started with [Notion](https://www.notion.com/) in 2022...

While working on [RINAIBRA](/projects/rinaibra/) I was learning from different channels as an entrepreneur:
+ entrepreneurship meetings 
+ incubator workshops
+ mentor sessions
+ Y Combinator
+ books

It got challenging to keep track of all the learnings on Goodnotes on my iPad, or on paper in my journals. I needed a better system so I did some research and kept being directed to Notion so I decided to pick it up.

It was free to get started and offered so many configurations meaning I could setup:
+ notes
+ task management
+ connections between related content

I stopped using Notion after I left [RINAIBRA](/projects/rinaibra/) but I miss a system to organise my note-taking as I now have a million markdown files spread across my computer and a million more notes on Google Keep.

It's 2025, so I'm keen to try something different rather than setup Notion again so I'm going with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) this time.

## Obsidian: The King of Learning Tools (FULL GUIDE + SETUP) by Odysseas
{{< youtube hSTy_BInQs8 >}}

Odysseas discusses why to use Obsidian and then walks us through his note organisation system.

### Avoiding Toxic Perfectionism
Obsidian like Notion is a complex tool wiht various themes and plugins so setting up a system that works for your situation can be complex. There's just so much to play around with so don't let this overwhelm you so waste a lot of your time.

By the end of the day, trying to configure the perfect Obsidian shouldn't get in the way of writing notes.

### Why use Obsidian?
Based on Odysseas's takeaways from reading *How to take smart notes* by SÃ¶nke Ahrens (the Zettelkasten system):
+ Great for learning.
    - **Keeps it slow**. To obtain more from reading you will have to slow down.
    - **Instant feedback**.
    - **Freedom to connect**.
+ Stores and mixes ideas.
    - One place to store all your notes.
    - As all the notes are in one place links between different notes can be made.
    - Support for links and tags.
+ Faster, easier writing.
    - Easy to search through your notes.
    - Personal writing assistant

### Getting started
1. Download from the Obsidian from [Obsidian download page](https://obsidian.md/download).
2. Install and run Obsidian on your computer.
3. What is a vault? The highest's level of organisation in the system. It is the folder that will contain all your notes.
    - This folder can be backed up on a cloud service like Google Drive.
4. Create folders for:
    - **1 - Rough Notes**. Incomplete notes that are a work in progress.
    - **2 - Source Materials**. Notes on learnings from books, videos, blog posts etc.
    - **3 - Tags**. Odysseas uses empty notes to represent tags and using `[[]]` to then add the tag in the note file.
    - **4 - Indexes**. A index to make it easier to view notes of a particular tag.
    - **5 - Template**
    - **6- Main Notes**. Also sometimes called in Atomic Notes or Zettelkasten. All main notes go in one folder!
5. The navigate to `Settings > Files and links > Default location for new notes` and set it to "In the folder specified below". Then from the next section `Folder to create new notes in` select the "6 - Main Notes" folder.
6. Then under the `Appearance` section of the Settings configure any template that you would like.
7. From the `Hotkeys` section of the Settings search for "template" and add "Ctrl + T" to make it easy to create a template.
    - It may conflict with the Hotkey for a tab for search for "tab" and remove "Ctrl + T" to leave it blank.
8. Then navigate to the `Core plugins` section and ensure "Templates" and "Backlinks" is toggled on.
    - You add "Community plugins" if you would like but keep it simple, adding too many plugins can overcomplicate the system.
9. Create a template for "Main Notes" - timestamp: **22:30**-**24:03**.
10. Create a new note - timestamp: **24:03**-**24:58**. Use "Ctrl + O".
    - Odysseas then discusses how to write a note and comments on avoiding passive learning.
    - Keep notes short - below 500 words. Try have it fit on one page.
    - Tackle one idea at a time in a note. You can break things over multiple notes and link them together.
    - Format notes so that they are easy to read.
11. Tagging
    - Avoid vague tags i.e. too broad.
    - Avoid specific tags - otherwise you may never use it again.
    - Tags should serve you and you alone. Don't worry about popular tagging systems that others would understand.
