Firstly, before we get into the topic, don't search *"rust youtubers"* on YouTube you will just get videos of a bunch of YouTubers playing the game Rust:

## Why do I want to learn Rust?
+ **I miss the joy of learning**. Studying Computer Science was amazing because I got to learn so many cool things all the time.
+ **I need a new tool**. I feel I haven't added anything significant to my Dev arsenal since working on [RINAIBRA](/projects/rinaibra/).
+ **I want to challenge myself**. I hear Rust has a steep learning curve so I feel this is the right challenge to take on this year.
+ **Follow a trend**. I want to explore a trending technology for once. I feel a lot of the technologies I mess around with are old. Rust just looks clean and feels modern in it's approach to things.

## Resources I will be using
+ **The Book**. [The Rust Programming Language
](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) by Steve Klabnik and Carol Nichols
+ **Practical**
    - [Rust by Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/)
    - [rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings/)
    - [Rust by Practice](https://practice.course.rs/)
+ For projects:
    - [Command line apps in Rust](https://rust-cli.github.io/book/index.html)

## Gaps to fill

+ [Stack, Heap, and Static Memory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnLdGKoz1ls&list=PLai5B987bZ9BnS7dBlTF9HRop55vYUL7r&index=2)
+ [The Cherno](https://www.youtube.com/@TheCherno)
    - For C++ fundamentals like: RAII pattern and references.
+ Functional programming
