## How to write technical blog posts - talk by Quincy Larson

{{< youtube YODPgBadj80 >}}

This presentation was given by Quincy Larson the founder of [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/). He worked as a journalist for about 3 years and as a teacher for 10 years. Technical blogging was critical to freeCodeCamp's early growth as a community.

The goal of the video:

> To give you the tools and confidence to write technical blog posts people will actually read.

To do this a technical writer requires:
+ Substance
    - **Write something that matters**. All the buzzwords in the world can't save your writing if it doesn't have substance.
    - **Do your home**. Know the topic you're writing about and what's been written about it.
    - **What's missing**? Once you've done your homework, figure out what's missing.
    - **Substance takes hard work**. Expect to put an hour or more into every minute the reader will spend reading.
+ Packaging
    - Package that substance for consumption.
    - Packaging is very important.
    - What is packaging?
        - Headline
        - Images
        - Formatting
        - Platform
    - **A good headline makes all the difference**. All about 90% of people will ever read. *Empires have been built on the backs of headlines. Anyone ever heard of Buzzfeed?"* If you're going to fine-tune one aspect of your story, make it the headline.
    - **Humans are visual creatures**. *"A recent study found that 86% of top blog posts include at least one image. On average, they have at least one image for every 350 words."*
    - **Break up text with subheads, pull quotes**. Avoid large clunky sections of text.
    - **Where you post your writing makes a big difference**.
+ Publicising
    - Where do you put it and what do you say about it?
    - **The last 10% of the work takes 90% of the time**. Publicising your work is the last 10% and is going to take 90% of your time.
    - **It's a lottery**. You don't have control. But you have to play to win.
    - Distribution channels:
        - Hacker News
        - Facebook groups
        - LinkedIn (if you are desperate for views)
        - Use other people's audiences e.g. Medium, Forbes, TechCrunch

### But it's all been written before
That's not true, there is always a new angle Quincy says. There are so many permutations based on:
+ Experience level
+ Level of detail
+ Language or technology specific
+ Difference example application of concept
+ Humor

Always a way to make original spins on old topics. In fact, Quincy finds that most articles are written from a beginner *"Hello, World"* prospective or *"I have been coding for 10 years"*. So there's a gap in the middle for intermediatory takes.
