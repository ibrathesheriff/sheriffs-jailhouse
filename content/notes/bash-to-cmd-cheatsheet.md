A cheatsheet of the command prompt version of commonly used bash commands because I'm tired of googling these.

## Open cmd
**Windows Key + R** to open the Run program and type "cmd" and then hit Enter to open a new Command Prompt shell.

## cd
Lucky you, this is just `cd`!

## ls
```shell
dir
```

## cat
```shell
type nul > your_file.txt
```

## mkdir
Lucky you, this is just `mkdir`!

## touch
```shell
type nul > your_file.txt
```

## exit
Lucky you, this is just `exit`!
