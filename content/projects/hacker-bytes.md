[Hacker Bytes](https://hackerbytes.hackthedegree.com/) is the the official blog of hackthedegree. It's part of the [hackthedegree project](/projects/hackthedegree) and the plan is to use unconventional learning methods to teach my students programming concepts.

It's a passion project that I would like to one day support:
+ Unconventional tricks and tips
+ In-depth guides and tutorials
+ Inspiring stories and interviews
+ Engaging challenges and projects

**Fun fact**: I built my own ORM for this project.
