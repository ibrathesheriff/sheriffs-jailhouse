With [hackthedegree](https://www.hackthedegree.com/) I am attempting to build:
> The modern-day tutoring service for programming students.

I'm on a passion-fuelled mission to empower students with the art of programming. My goal is to equip them with the skills to build practical and useful programs upon graduation. [hackthedegree](https://www.hackthedegree.com/) is how intend to do that.

It's a passion project that I would like to one day support:
+ Booking tutor sessions.
+ Paying for tutor sessions.
+ Completing exercises to solidify new concepts and practice for assessments.
+ Hosting of resources to help students learn.
