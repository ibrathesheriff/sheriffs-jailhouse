[RINAIBRA](https://www.sun.ac.za/english/Lists/news/DispForm.aspx?ID=8988) was a Maintenance Communication System(MCS) which allows tenants to report maintenance issues so that maintenance administrators can coordinate their repair.

The project was started at Stellenbosch University to aid university residence maintenance management specifically. As a Co-Founder, I was solely responsible for Product Development and Product Management.

This project was a trial by fire. I was tasked with building a robust solution capable of handling the demands of over 7500 students daily during the semester, while simultaneously learning to manage two other developers. This experience forced me to quickly develop both my technical and leadership skills, proving to be an invaluable lesson in startup management.
