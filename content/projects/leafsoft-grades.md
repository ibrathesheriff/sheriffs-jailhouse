Leafsoft Grades is a student management system which allows schools to have a central store of student personal information, track academic progress and store attendance records. It is the flagship product of [Leafsoft PL](https://github.com/leafsoftpl) and was my first major startup experience.

At this point in my journey I was not a Programmer so my role was finance-related, Chief Financial Officer.

My responsibilities spanned a wide range of areas, including:
+ **Financial Management**: Overseeing daily financial operations, budgeting, financial projections, government filings, and product pricing strategies.
+ **Marketing and Quality Assurance**: Actively participating in marketing efforts and identifying and reporting software bugs to ensure product quality.

This experience provided me with valuable insights into the complexities of school administration in Zimbabwe and the power of technology to create solutions. This marked my first involvement in product testing.
