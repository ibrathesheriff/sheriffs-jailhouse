I have been writing posts for my coding education project [hackthedegree](https://hackerbytes.hackthedegree.com/) since last year but I have struggled to write for my personal site.
<!--more-->
Funny enough I first setup my personal site [ibrathesheriff.com](https://ibrathesheriff.com/) in 2022 as a:
+ digital CV
+ and to write posts to share with Operations Research and Computer Programming students I was tutoring.

But still, I haven't been able to commit to the idea of maintaining a website to share my personal experiences, ideas, and thoughts on things. So why now?

+ A place to dump ideas - empty my head
+ We didn't know. A place to add information so it is accessible.

So here goes nothing!

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    printf("%s\n", "Hello, World?");
}
```
