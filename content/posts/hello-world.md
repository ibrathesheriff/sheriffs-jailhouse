I have been writing posts for my coding education project [hackthedegree](https://hackerbytes.hackthedegree.com/) since last year but I have struggled to write for my personal site.
<!--more-->
Funny enough I first setup my personal site [ibrathesheriff.com](https://ibrathesheriff.com/) in 2022 as a:
+ digital CV
+ and to write posts to share with my Operations Research and Computer Programming students I was tutoring.

But still, I haven't been able to commit to the idea of maintaining a website to share my personal experiences, ideas, and thoughts on things. So why now?

## A place to dump ideas - empty my head
> Your mind is for having ideas, not holding them. - David Allen, author of Getting Things Done
Some call it the second brain, I don't know about that but 

Reflect
> People who write a lot, also listen a lot. They also change their mind a lot. Not necessarily with new data, but sometimes re-analyzing the same data. They also work hard to disconfirm fundamental biases. - Jeff Bezos

## To write well is to think clearly
> Writing is thinking. To write well is to think clearly. That's why it's so hard. - David McCullough, Interview with NEH chairman Bruce Cole, Humanities, July/Aug. 2002, Vol. 23/No. 4

## Your singular perspective may patch some small hole in the vast tattered fabric of humanity
> There never has been, nor will there ever be, another like you. Your singular perspective may patch some small hole in the vast tattered fabric of humanity. Uniqueness alone, however, does not make you valuable. If you don't do, if you don't dare, then you rob the world—and yourself—of the chance to contribute something meaningful. - Ryder Carroll, The Bullet Journal Method

"You are best positioned to help people one step behind you" by Rachel Thomas

## To save time
Blog post you can share for commonly asked questions

## Control over the display of content

## We didn't know. A place to add information so it is accessible.

## Level up
> When you know you’re going to write, you change the way you live. You can no longer sleepwalk through life. The most powerful insights come from everyday experiences that people ignore.

The best way to learn faster is to have a stake in the outcome. Risk awakens our learning muscles like a splash of cold water. If you want to learn to cook invite friends over for dinner; if you want to learn about stocks, invest in the stock market; and if you want to learn about an idea, publish an article about it.

> If you wish you would take something more seriously, do it publicly… Social pressure forces you to up your game - James Clear

I came to these points upon reflections from reading/watching:

So here goes nothing!

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    printf("%s\n", "Hello, World?");
}
```
