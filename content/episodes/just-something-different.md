I have been struggling for the past years to build a coding education platform that I feel will actually move the needle forward in terms of helping beginners truly understanding basic programming concepts. When I started [hackthedegree.com](https://www.hackthedegree.com/) my focus was on tutoring but after leaving RINAIBRA I have wanted to pivot the platform towards offering courses. But I have simply struggled to wrap my head around what that would look like.

I have been inspired by platforms like:
+ [boot.dev](https://boot.dev/)
+ [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/)
+ [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)
+ [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/)

Too many of the ideas I have developed up to now have just felt like variations of the work done by these platforms. *What's different about my idea x?*

I want to try something totally different based on my student's feedback. Let's see if it will work.

It's called **nervebird**.
