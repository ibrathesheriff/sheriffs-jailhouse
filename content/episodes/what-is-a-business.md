Deya's video titled ["How I Build Systems (so my business runs without me)"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEYF6VvgOic) got me thinking about:
+ What is a business?
+ What is my relationship to the business?
+ How important should I be to the general continuity of the business?

## What is a business?
> One does not have to show up in order to earn money - Sam Carpenter, Work the System

## What happens if you take a 7-day vacation?
![Relaxing at the beach](/img/episodes/business/relaxing-at-the-beach.jpg)

The idea that Deya pushes in this video is that if you cannot take a 7-day vacation without your business operations being disrupted then you are not running a business but rather, *you have a job*.

> Your task is to optimise one system after another, not careen through the day randomly taking care of whatever problems erupt. - Sam Carpenter, Work the System

Your job is not to be a fire killer. *Your job is to prevent fires* i.e. to develop systems to avoid chaos.

## The cost of not having systems
+ The business only exists in the business owner's brain.
+ Takes way more mental energy to accomplish a task because you have to manually think about how it gets done.
+ Can't delegate tasks
    - Can't hire/outsource.
    - Can't scale.
+ Inconsistent output + quality + (potentially costly) mistakes happen.

## What is a system?
> A System is a collection of repeatable processes designed to produce consistent results without starting from scratch each time and to reach a specific goal. - Deya

## Steps to cleaning it up: Developing systems
These are the steps Deya proposes to develop systems.

### Step 1: What's in your brain?
Identify the list of business tasks related to:
+ Daily, weekly and monthly processes.
+ Marketing
+ Product
+ Team

You will then end up with a list of tasks for example:
+ Morning meetings
+ Ordering product X from Y weekly.
+ Creating graphics for social media posts.
+ Daily sales reporting.
+ ...

### Step 2: Score to prioritise
Write out the tasks identified in Step (1) into a table with the following headings:
+ Task
+ Frequency. Rate out of 5. Daily = 5, weekly = 4, bi-weekly = 4, monthly = 3 etc.
+ Annoyance. Rate of out 5. 1 = not annoying to do at all, 5 = super annoying to do for you.
+ Impact. Rate out of 5. 1 = low impact to business goals, 5 = high impact task that's relevant to business goals.
+ Simplicity. Rate out of 5. 1 = super easy to do, 5 = difficult.
+ Delegation Priority Score

The Delegation Priority Score is computed as follows:
```text
(Frequency + Annoyance + Impact + Simplicity) / 4
```
i.e. Delegation Priority Score = the average of all the columns.

### Step 3: 
Mark each task as:
+ **DELETE**
+ **AUTOMATE**
+ **DELEGATE**

No impact busywork should be marked as **DELETE**. These are tasks your business should just stop doing.

Is there a tool that you can use to automate a task? Then mark that task as **AUTOMATE**.

If it's impactful, but annoying and someone else can do it 80% as well as you then mark as **DELEGATE**. This is a task you can delegate to someone else in your team.

### Step 4: Current owner vs. Ideal owner
Add 2 columns to the table from Step (2):
+ Current Owner: who in the business is currently responsible for task?
+ Ideal Owner: who would be the ideal employee to handle this task? The answer can be, "we need to hire the ideal person".

### Step 5: Document tasks
+ Create checklists
+ Create templates where possible e.g. emails, YouTube descriptions, Instagram graphics
+ Review tools (e.g. software). Do you have too many? Do you have the correct tools for the tasks?
+ Choose a documentation approach e.g. video tutorial, written guide, guide with a decision tree. Ensure to include examples.

## Personal Reflection
Why this video from Deya got me thinking is because I have felt for a while that [hackthedegree](https://www.hackthedegree.com/) is not yet a business. I tutor 99% of the students and have struggled to invest in the tutor system. This means that when I take a vacation the revenue goes to essentially zero.

I have turned [hackthedegree](https://www.hackthedegree.com/) into a *job* not a *business*. I need to change the way I am doing things immediately to truly develop it into a business.
