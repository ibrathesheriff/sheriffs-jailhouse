Internet service providers in Zimbabwe are seriously horrible. The market is an oligopoly, meaning the providers have remained unchallenged for years.

[Tweet by Michael]

This tweet is not lying. There are providers that have such poor speeds that it's better to grab a flash and cycle the data yourself to the intended recipient. I have had to deal with:
+ Poor speeds
    - Some providers have max speeds of about 1.2 Mbps
    - Some providers will are messing around in the Kbps!
+ Dead-zones: there's days where the service will just be down.
    - There's a provider I once used that only gave you 15-20 days of actual uptime per month. The rest of the month I was just left chilling in the dark.
+ Expensive
    - I studied in South Africa and had access to some great WIFI connections. They cost a fraction of what I was paying in Zimbabwe. Like R450 vs. R4650. I mean, what the hell?
