In September 2022, I launched this website with the intention of showcasing my skills and experience, including my portfolio of projects, technical abilities, and accomplishments.

At this point I was doing a lot of tutoring work for [Rheinmetall Barzan Advanced Technologies](https://www.linkedin.com/company/rheinmetall-barzan-advanced-technologies-qstp-llc). They had 17 Qatari students on their South Africa bursary programme and I had to help them with Computer Science and Operations Research modules. So the second major reason I setup this website was to write blog posts on:
+ Python
+ C
+ Operations Research
+ Linear Algebra
+ Statistics

designed to reinforce the concepts I was teaching and provide additional support for my students. 

If you are interested in the elements that inspired the design my note on [My Site Inspiration](notes/my-site-inspiration/).

Because the original site was built with static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, managing individual blog posts and maintaining a consistent design proved challenging. Consequently, in 2023, I transitioned my technical blog posts to [hackthedegree](https://www.hackthedegree.com/), hence the absence of blog links on the old site. I did, however, enjoy experimenting with [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) for rendering mathematical expressions on the initial blog.
