## aha moment...
Building a **Sudoku game in Java sparked a passion** for programming I never knew I had. Something about breaking down the game into modules, functions and loops **made me feel something I cannot explain**. Now I'm dedicated to **helping others experience that same "aha!" moment**.

## background
My journey into programming began in 2016 at [Leafsoft PL](https://github.com/leafsoftpl), where I worked alongside [Alec](https://github.com/alecmus), a true C++ wizard. At the time, my role at the startup was finance-focused, but a seed of curiosity for coding was planted.

With a strong performance in Cambridge Advanced Level Mathematics (I scored an A), I was encouraged to pursue Actuarial Science. It made sense - I've always been fascinated by the finance industry and its intricate markets. (One of my favorite movies is **The Big Short**!) In 2017, I embarked on my journey as an Actuarial Science student at Stellenbosch University. But fate had other plans. For the first time, Professor Slattery, the head of the department, made Computer Science a compulsory course for first-semester students. That’s how I found myself stepping into the world of Java programming - it was as if the stars had aligned.

So...I absolutely hated programming :/

My initial excitement quickly faded when we started learning about loops. Something about repeatedly iterating a block of code while checking a condition just didn't click for me. I hit a mental block. Yet, two weeks before the semester project deadline, everything suddenly fell into place. The semester’s concepts - modules, functions, loops, conditions, logic - clicked together like puzzle pieces, leading to my first big **"aha!" moment**.

By the second semester, I had switched from Actuarial Science to Computer Science, and I've never looked back.

Today, I'm passionate about **helping others experience their own "aha!" moment**. My mission is to empower students with the skills to confidently build practical and impactful software. I want to inspire them to see programming not as a challenge but as a powerful tool for innovation and problem-solving.

## what I can offer
My experience in Academia, Entrepreneurship and Software Development have prepared me to offer the following:
+ **Web Development**: Driven by a passion for crafting engaging web solutions, I've spent the past few years deeply immersing myself in web development. This journey has equipped me with proficiency in diverse technologies like *Python*, *Vue.js*, *MySQL*, and *MariaDB*.
+ **Design Thinking and Lean Methodology**: I leverage my software development skills to fuel entrepreneurial ventures, consistently applying these methodologies to create impactful projects.
+ **Instruction**: Witnessing the *"aha!"* moments in a student's eyes fuels my passion for teaching. My journey from Teaching Assistant to private tutor in Computer Science and Scientific Computing allows me to personalise the learning experience, igniting curiosity and guiding students towards mastery.

## some of my accolades
My Academia, Entrepreneurship and Software Development journey has attracted various accolades, awarding effort, excellence and innovation:
+ **Academic Award**: At Stellenbosch University, my dedication to excellence in Scientific Computing and Computer Science was rewarded with an impressive 83.44% average. This achievement earned me membership in the [Golden Key International Honour Society](https://www.goldenkey.org/). Founded in 1977, the Golden Key recognizes top academic performers like myself, acknowledging students within the top 15% of their class.
+ **Graduate Award**: Companies that sponsor [Gradstar](https://gradstar.co.za/) are amongst the top employers in South Africa who are looking to get access to the best graduate talent from South African universities, as well as create opportunities for the identified talent.
In 2020, my dedication to student leadership at Stellenbosch University combined with my academic aptitude earned me a coveted spot in the Gradstar Top 500. This recognition unlocks exclusive access to exciting career prospects with some of South Africa's most prestigious employers.
+ **Entrepreneurship Award**: The Stellenbosch Network is a cross-sector and inter-disciplinary membership organisation that brings people together - from industry, government, society, and academia.
Every month the Stellenbosch Network features an inspiring local entrepreneur or an innovative start-up making waves. For our work on RINAIBRA, my co-founder and I were awarded the [Stellenbosch Network's Entrepreneur of the Month](https://www.stellenboschnetwork.co.za/apr2021-sbos-eotm/) in April 2021.
