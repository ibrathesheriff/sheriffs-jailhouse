Building a **Sudoku game in Java sparked a passion** for programming I never knew I had. Something about breaking down the game into modules, functions and loops **made me feel something I cannot explain**. Now I'm dedicated to **helping others experience that same "aha!" moment**.

## What I can offer
My experience in Academia, Entrepreneurship and Software Development have prepared me to offer the following:
+ **Web Development**: Driven by a passion for crafting engaging web solutions, I've spent the past few years deeply immersing myself in web development. This journey has equipped me with proficiency in diverse technologies like *Python*, *Java*, *Vue.js*, *Neo4j*, *MySQL*, and *MariaDB*.
+ **Design Thinking and Lean Methodology**: I leverage my software development skills to fuel entrepreneurial ventures, consistently applying these methodologies to create impactful projects.
+ **Instruction**: Witnessing the *"aha!"* moments in a student's eyes fuels my passion for teaching. My journey from Teaching Assistant to private tutor in Computer Science and Scientific Computing allows me to personalize the learning experience, igniting curiosity and guiding students towards mastery.

## Some of my Accolades
My Academia, Entrepreneurship and Software Development journey has attracted various accolades, awarding effort, excellence and innovation:
