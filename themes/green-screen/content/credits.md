Creating this website has been a journey, and like any meaningful endeavor, it wasn't done in isolation. This page is dedicated to acknowledging the resources, tools, and individuals who played a pivotal role in bringing this site to life. From tutorials and open-source projects to friends who lent their support or advice, this is my way of saying thank you. Explore the links, discover the contributors, and join me in celebrating the collective creativity that made this project possible.

## Hugo Community
I would like to express my gratitude to Brian P. Hogan and his book, [Building Websites With Hugo](/notes/building-websites-with-hugo/), for providing the initial foundation for this project.  However, it's the ongoing support and contributions of the Hugo community that have truly enabled me to reach this point.
